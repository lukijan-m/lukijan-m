## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a passionate data enthusiast with a keen interest in Sports and Education. My data journey began during the latter part of my bachelorâ€™s degree in Economics at the University of Vienna. Since then, I have gained valuable experience in the EdTech and iGaming industries, continuously refining my skills and expanding my knowledge in data analytics.
